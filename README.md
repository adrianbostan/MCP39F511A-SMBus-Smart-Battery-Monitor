## MCP39F521 Features

The **MCP39F521** is a highly integrated, single-phase power-monitoring IC designed for real-time measurement of input power for AC/DC power supplies, providing power and energy values. It includes dual-channel delta sigma ADCs, a 16-bit calculation engine, EEPROM and a flexible 2-wire interface. An integrated low-drift voltage reference in addition to the 94.5 dB of SINAD performance on each measurement channel allows for better than 0.1% accurate designs across a 4000:1 dynamic range.
